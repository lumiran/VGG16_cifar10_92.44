VGG16_cifar10_92.44

It is the pytorch version of http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html which is a lua + torch version.

A small correction: I use 0.1 as the initial learning rate, rather than 1 in the original intruction via lua+torch.

You can find the well trained model in Baidu Netdisk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FDAgKgF7KGSOmizfeoYyBg with the codes: vbs7 
It has an accuracy of 92.44.
